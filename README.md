## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Anani-jrvs](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Anani-jrvs)


**Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Anani-jrvs/tree/masterhttps://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Anani-jrvs/tree/feature/psql_docker/linux_sql)]: Managed a Linux cluster of 10 nodes/servers running CentOS 7 used by the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA). These servers are internally connected through a switch and able to communicate through internal IPv4 addresses. The functionality of the project is to record the hardware specifications of each node and monitor node resource usage (e.g. CPU, memory) in real-time. The collected data is stored in an RDBMS. The LCA team will use the data to generate reports for future resource planning purposes (add or remove servers).
